NodeJS - AngularJS Skeleton
====
A design portfolio

Initial Setup
----
- Make sure you have NodeJS installed
- Run npm install to install all application dependencies
- Run bower install to install all javascript/css dependencies

That's it, you're done!

Running the app locally
----
- Open a command line terminal and make sure your current directory is at the root of this project
- Run 'npm start'

There should be some command line output telling you how to open the app in a browser.

Stopping the app locally
----
- In the same command line terminal as you started in just press 'ctrl + c'
- If you are in a different terminal then run 'npm stop'
